# Traffic-Light-VHDL
Implementation of a traffic light system in VHDL language.
The following VHDL and test bench files have been designed and tested in ISE Design Suite 14.7.
4-side traffic light system, each with 4 traffic signals (red, yellow, green, pedestrian) is implemented,along with 4 sensors that check the traffic in one road at any point in time.
Testbench file is best simulated under iSim environment.
